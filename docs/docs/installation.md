# Installation

You can use npm

```
npm install --save react-tag-input
```

or via Yarn

```js
yarn add react-tag-input
```
make sure you have installed the **peer dependencies** as well with below versions
```
"react": "^17.0.2",
"react-dnd": "^14.0.2",
"react-dnd-html5-backend": "^14.0.0",
"react-dom": "17.0.2"

```
It is, however, also available to be used separately (`dist/ReactTags.min.js`). If you prefer this method remember to include [ReactDND](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd) as a dependancy. Refer to the [example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-tag-input) to see how this works.
