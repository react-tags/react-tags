React-tags is a simple tagging component ready to drop in your projects. The component is inspired by GMail's *To* field in the compose window.

## Features

- Autocomplete based on a suggestion list
- Keyboard friendly and mouse support
- Reorder tags using drag and drop
- Edit tag support
- Optional clear all button

## Why

Started by [Prakhar Srivastav](https://github.com/prakhar1989) and later maintained by [Aakansha Doshi](https://github.com/ad1992).
In Prakhar's words here is why he started itüëáüèª
Because I was looking for an excuse to build a standalone component and publish it in the wild? To be honest, I needed a tagging component that provided the above features for my [React-Surveyman](http://github.com/prakhar1989/react-surveyman) project. Since I was unable to find one which met my requirements (and the fact that I generally enjoy re-inventing the wheel) this is what I came up with.

## Preparing for Migration to v7.x.x

Below are the list of `deprecated` props so please stop using it and migrate to the new props as these will be removed in `v7.x.x`.
You will see a warning for the migration as well in the console.

- `delimiters` - Please use [`separators`](#separators) instead, more info in [this issue](https://github.com/react-tags/react-tags/issues/960).
- `inline` - Please use [`inputFieldPosition`](#inputFieldPosition) instead.
- `autofocus` - Please use [`autoFocus`](#autoFocus) instead.

Additionally the prop `autocomplete` is deprecated and will be removed in `v7.x.x`. If you have any concerns regarding this, please share your thoughts in [this issue](https://github.com/react-tags/react-tags/issues/949).

## Thanks

The autocomplete dropdown is inspired by Lea Verou's [awesomeplete](https://github.com/LeaVerou/awesomplete) library. The Drag and drop functionality is provided by Dan Abramov's insanely useful [ReactDND](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd) library.

Also thanks to the awesome contributors who've made the library far better!
